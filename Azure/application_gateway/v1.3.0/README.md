## Notes:
> Availability Zones are only supported in several regions at this time. They are also only supported for v2 SKUs
> TLS termination with Key Vault certificates is limited to the v2 SKUs.
> For TLS termination with Key Vault certificates to work properly existing user-assigned managed identity, which Application Gateway uses to retrieve certificates from Key Vault, should be defined via identity block. Additionally, access policies in the Key Vault to allow the identity to be granted get access to the secret should be defined.
> The host_names and host_name are mutually exclusive and cannot both be set.
> The AllowApplicationGatewayPrivateLink feature must be registered on the subscription before enabling private link
> backend_address_pool_name, backend_http_settings_name, redirect_configuration_name, and rewrite_rule_set_name are applicable only when rule_type is Basic.
> The priority field is mandatory with AzureRM release 3.6.0 and later.
> request_routing_rule_priority is required when sku.0.tier is set to *_v2.

> disabled_protocols cannot be set when policy_name or policy_type are set.

> ssl_certificate_data - When specifying a file, use data = filebase64("path/to/file") to encode the contents of that file.
> url_path_map- Both default_backend_address_pool_name and default_backend_http_settings_name or default_redirect_configuration_name should be specified.
> url - One or both of path and query_string must be specified. If one of these is not specified, it means the value will be empty. If you only want to rewrite path or query_string, use components.
