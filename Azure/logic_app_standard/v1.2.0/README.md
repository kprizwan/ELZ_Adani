# Note

- There are a number of application settings that will be managed for you by this resource type and shouldn't be configured separately as part of the app_settings you specify. AzureWebJobsStorage is filled based on storage_account_name and storage_account_access_key. WEBSITE_CONTENTSHARE is detailed below. FUNCTIONS_EXTENSION_VERSION is filled based on version. APP_KIND is set to workflowApp and AzureFunctionsJobHost__extensionBundle__id and AzureFunctionsJobHost__extensionBundle__version are set as detailed below.
- When integrating a CI/CD pipeline and expecting to run from a deployed package in Azure you must seed your app settings as part of terraform code for Logic App to be successfully deployed. Important Default key pairs: ("WEBSITE_RUN_FROM_PACKAGE" = "", "FUNCTIONS_WORKER_RUNTIME" = "node" (or Python, etc), "WEBSITE_NODE_DEFAULT_VERSION" = "10.14.1", "APPINSIGHTS_INSTRUMENTATIONKEY" = "").
- When using an App Service Plan in the Free or Shared Tiers use_32_bit_worker_process must be set to true.
- Assigning the virtual_network_subnet_id property requires RBAC permissions on the subnet
- For container mode you must set azurerm_app_service_plan kind to Linux and reserved to true when used with linux_fx_version.
- On regional virtual network integration: The AzureRM Terraform provider provides regional virtual network integration via the standalone resource app_service_virtual_network_swift_connection and in-line within this resource using the virtual_network_subnet_id property. You cannot use both methods simutaneously.
- Assigning the virtual_network_subnet_id property requires RBAC permissions on the subnet
- User has to explicitly set ip_restriction to empty slice ([]) to remove it.
- User has to explicitly set scm_ip_restriction to empty slice ([]) to remove it.
- when using an App Service Plan in the Free or Shared Tiers use_32_bit_worker_process must be set to true.
- You can access the Principal ID via azurerm_app_service.example.identity.0.principal_id and the Tenant ID via azurerm_app_service.example.identity.0.tenant_id
- When type is set to SystemAssigned, The assigned principal_id and tenant_id can be retrieved after the Logic App has been created. More details are available below.
- The identity_ids is required when type is set to UserAssigned or SystemAssigned, UserAssigned.
- One of either ip_address, service_tag or virtual_network_subnet_id must be specified.
