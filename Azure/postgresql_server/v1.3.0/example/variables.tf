    postgresql_server_name                                 = string   #(Required) Specifies the name of the PostgreSQL Server. Changing this forces a new resource to be created.
    postgresql_server_location                             = string   #(Required) Specifies the supported Azure location where the resource exists. Changing this forces a new resource to be created.
    postgresql_server_resource_group_name                  = string   #(Required) The name of the resource group in which to create the PostgreSQL Server. Changing this forces a new resource to be created.
    postgresql_server_administrator_login                  = string   #(Optional) The Administrator login for the PostgreSQL Server. Required when create_mode is Default. Changing this forces a new resource to be created.
    postgresql_server_sku_name                             = string   #(Required) Specifies the SKU Name for this PostgreSQL Server. The name of the SKU, follows the tier + family + cores pattern (e.g. B_Gen4_1, GP_Gen5_8).
    postgresql_server_version                              = string   #(Required) Specifies the version of PostgreSQL to use. Valid values are 9.5, 9.6, 10, 10.0, 10.2 and 11. Changing this forces a new resource to be created.
    postgresql_server_storage_mb                           = number   #(Optional) Max storage allowed for a server. Possible values are between 5120 MB(5GB) and 1048576 MB(1TB) for the Basic SKU and between 5120 MB(5GB) and 16777216 MB(16TB) for General Purpose/Memory Optimized SKUs. For more information see the product documentation.
    postgresql_server_backup_retention_days                = number   #(Optional) Backup retention days for the server, supported values are between 7 and 35 days.
    postgresql_server_geo_redundant_backup_enabled         = bool     #(Optional) Turn Geo-redundant server backups on/off. This allows you to choose between locally redundant or geo-redundant backup storage in the General Purpose and Memory Optimized tiers. When the backups are stored in geo-redundant backup storage, they are not only stored within the region in which your server is hosted, but are also replicated to a paired data center. This provides better protection and ability to restore your server in a different region in the event of a disaster. This is not support for the Basic tier. Changing this forces a new resource to be created.
    postgresql_server_auto_grow_enabled                    = bool     #(Optional) Enable/Disable auto-growing of the storage. Storage auto-grow prevents your server from running out of storage and becoming read-only. If storage auto grow is enabled, the storage automatically grows without impacting the workload. The default value if not explicitly specified is true.
